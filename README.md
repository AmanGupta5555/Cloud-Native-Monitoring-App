This project is a step-by-step guide to building and deploying a cloud-native Python application for resource monitoring on Kubernetes (K8s).

 It does the following:

    Building the Python App: Create's a Flask application using Python to monitor resources and visualize them.
    Dockerizing the App: Containerizing the application using Docker, creating a Docker image, and running it locally.
